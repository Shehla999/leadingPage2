              Healthcare-explore routinely gathers data on the website and
              mobile application activity, such as how many people visit the
              sites, the web pages they visit, where they come from, how long
              they stay, etc. The data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous
              basis, which means that no personally identifiable information is
              associated with the data. This data helps us improve our content
              and overall usage. The information is not shared with other
              organizations for their independent use. The Websites do not honor

            <p class="text-sm">
              We may also occasionally use “Web beacons” (also known as “clear
              gifs,” “Web bugs,” “1-pixel gifs,” etc.) that allow us to collect
              non-personal information about your response to our email
              communications, and for other purposes. Web beacons are tiny
              images, placed on a Web page or email, that can tell us if you’ve
              gone to a particular area on our website. For example, if you’ve
              given us permission to send you emails, we may send you an email
              urging you to use a certain feature on our website. If you do
              respond to that email and use that feature, the Web beacon will
              tell us that our email communication with you has been successful.
              We do not collect any personal information with a Web beacon.
              Since Web beacons are used in conjunction with persistent cookies
              (described above), if you set your browser to decline or
              deactivate cookies, Web beacons cannot function.

              We may place Internet “cookies” on the computer hard drives of

              us to tailor our sites to be more helpful and efficient for our
              visitors. The cookie consists of a unique identifier that does not
              contain information about you or your health history. We use two
              types of cookies, “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.

              web or app browser. We use session cookies to help customize your
              experience on our site, maintain your signed-on status as you
              navigate through our features, and to track your “click path”
              through our Web pages. Persistent cookies remain on your hard
              drive after you’ve exited from our website, and we use them for
              several reasons. For instance, if you’ve given us permission to
              email you with information, we may place a persistent cookie on
              your hard drive that will let us know when you come back to visit
              our site. We sometimes use this type of persistent cookie with a
              “Web beacon” (see below). Persistent cookies will not contain any
              personal information about you. You may have software on your
              computer that will allow you to decline or deactivate Internet
              cookies, but if you do so, some features of the Websites may not
              work properly for you. For instructions on how to remove cookies
              from your hard drive, go to your browser’s website for detailed
              instructions. In addition, further information regarding cookies
              may be available on other websites or from your Internet service
              provider. Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and iOS
              browsers are commonly used browsers.

            </h2>

              We maintain standard Web logs that record data about all visitors
              and customers who use the Websites and we store this information.
              These logs may contain the Internet domain from which you access
              the site (such as aol.com, abc.org, etc.); the IP address which is
              automatically assigned to your computer when you get on the
              Internet (a static IP address may be identifiable as being
              connected to you, while a dynamic address is usually not
              identifiable); the type of browser and operating system you use;
              the date and time you visited; the pages; and the address of the
              website you linked from, if any. All Web logs are stored securely,
              and may only be accessed by healthcare-explore employees or
              designees on a need-to-know basis for a specific purpose.
              healthcare-explore uses Web log information to help us design our
              Websites, to identify popular features, to resolve user, hardware,
              and software problems, and to make the Websites more useful to
              visitors.
